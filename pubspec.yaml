  # Note: flutter_switch is kept (not migrated to native Switch) because it provides critical features
  # that are NOT available in Flutter's native Switch widget:
  # - Custom width/height/toggleSize dimensions
  # - ON/OFF text indicators (showOnOff)
  # - Full border customization (BoxBorder support)
  # - Arbitrary widget icons (not limited to Material 3 Icon widgets)
  # - Custom animation duration
  # Migration would result in breaking changes and feature loss. See analysis in:
  # .auto-claude/specs/001-improvement/FLUTTER_SWITCH_ANALYSIS.md
