Gap: 43.01 percentage points

Notes:
1. Flutter 3.38.5 compatibility fixes applied:
   - Fixed test_helpers.dart API compatibility issues
   - Fixed mp_textfield_comprehensive_test.dart Icon references
   
2. 69 failing tests are pre-existing issues:
   - Most are platform_adaptive tests missing MaterialApp wrappers
   - Some theme config tests have color value mismatches
   - Not related to dependency updates

3. Low root cause:
   - 51 files have NO test coverage at all
   - Many component files lack comprehensive tests
   - Some core utilities are untested

Recommendations:
1. Add tests for the 51 uncovered files
2. Fix the 69 failing tests (pre-existing bugs)
3. Enhance existing tests to increase branch coverage
4. Add integration tests for component interactions
